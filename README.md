# Medical Reminder App
This is a medical reminder app targeted to elderly patients who frequently forget their medications. The purpose of this app is to create a completely hands-free, user-friendly application that empowers elderly people who struggle with apps and technology. 

There are two types of users: doctors and patients. Doctors can add patients and remotely track their usage of medications as well as add, delete, or edit medications themselves. Using Artifical Intelligence, doctors can directly add Doctor Notes which will populate medications for the user. Medication data is used to automatically create reminders for the user, removing any unecessary work.

When patients recieve a medication reminder, a voice assistant verbalizes the name, dosage, and any optional notes about the medication. When patients affirmatively respond, the app logs that the user has taken the medication.
